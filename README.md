# Not Crazy Cinematic
A modpack that aims to brings cinematic beauty to Minecraft, without breaking the vanilla charm.

This pack is designed for players who want Minecraft to look and feel more immersive, atmospheric (and a bit dramatic), all while staying true to the vanilla Minecraft
experience. It enhances visuals, sounds, lighting, and ambience without flooding your game with over-the-top effects or overwhelming changes.
It also brings some quality of life features for a smoother experience.
